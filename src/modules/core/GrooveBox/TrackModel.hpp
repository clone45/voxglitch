  // Why does TrackModel Exist?  Well..
  // It's all about copying tracks.
  //
  // Moving the Track's variables into the TrackModel gives us the ability
  // to take advantage of c++'s ability to quickly copy structures and not
  // have to copy all of the variables one-by-one.  Since there are 128 tracks
  // (8 per memory bank), that would be a lot of copying.  Instead, we can either
  // use the assignment operator (=) or memcopy.
  //
  // However, IMPORTANT, don't add any pointers to this structure, because
  // they'd be "shallow copied" and all of the pointers would end up pointing
  // to the same thing instead of making a copy.
