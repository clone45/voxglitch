## Autobreak
![Autobreak](images/autobreak-front-panel-1.png)

Auotbreak turns an ordinary drum loop into a break beat.  Load up to 5 8-bar drum loops in .wav format using the right-click context menu, then attach a Clock input running at 16th notes.  That should be enough to hear some output.  Attach a sequencer's output to the Pattern input to modulate the breakbeat offset for maximum fun.

### Inputs

* SAMPLE - Selects from one of 5 loaded .wav files
* CLOCK IN - The module will slave the internal BPM to this clock input.  Feed it 16th notes for best results.
* SEQUENCE - Input for the breakbeat sequence.  A good choice the the Autodafe SEQ16
* RESET - Reset sample playback

### Outputs

* OUT - Left/Right stereo output

### Minimal Usage

1. Right click on the module to load a .wav sample in the first sample slot.  This should be a, 8 bar drum loop.
2. Attach a clock input to CLOCK IN running at 16th notes.  Use 8th notes or 32nd notes if the sample is playing too quickly or too slowly.
3. Attach an external sequencer (such as the Autodafe SEQ16) to the SEQUENCE input and use the sequencer to adjust the breakbeat pattern.
