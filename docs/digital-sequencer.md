## Digital Sequencer

![DigitalSequencer](images/digital-sequencer-front-panel-1.png)

Digital Sequencer is a variable length CV/Gate sequencer - times six!  It has both a master step input and individual step inputs for each of the six sequencers.  Additionally, it supports a variety of output ranges and snap input settings per sequencer.  It's especially useful if you need a lot of modulation in your patch.

### Inputs

* The main display - Draw on the display to modify either the CV values or gates underneath.
* STEP - Global step input (on the left) and individual step inputs (below sequence buttons).  Provide a clock style input to either the global step input or to individual step inputs.
* RESET - Resets all sequencers.
* LEN - Individual length control of the sequences, ranging from 1 to 32 steps.
* SEQ - Buttons with LEDs for selecting the sequence to edit.

### Outputs

* CV/Gate - CV and Gate outputs for each of the six sequencers.

### Quick Keys

* Left/Right arrows: When hovering over either the CV sequencer or gate sequencer, shifts the pattern to the left or right.
* Left/Right arrows + shift: Same as above, but shift both CV sequencer and gate sequencer in tandem.
* r: When hovering over either the CV sequencer or gate sequencer, randomizes the pattern.
* r + shift: Same as above, but randomizes both.
* Up/Down arrows: When hovering over a bar in the CV sequencer, adds or removes .01 from the value for fine tuning.

### Context menu

Right click on the module to access the context menu.  The context menu allows you to set output range or input snapping (quantization) for any of the six sequences.
