# Maya Vocabulary Bank Design

## Philosophy

The vocabulary is organized into **banks** that map to voltage ranges. This allows users to create meaningful phrases by combining CV sequences. Words are arranged so that grammatically and poetically sensible combinations emerge naturally from voltage patterns.

**Voltage-to-Bank Mapping:**
- 0.0V - 0.99V: Bank 1 (Pronouns/Subjects)
- 1.0V - 1.99V: Bank 2 (Verbs/Actions)
- 2.0V - 2.99V: Bank 3 (Descriptors/Adjectives)
- 3.0V - 3.99V: Bank 4 (Objects/Nouns)
- 4.0V - 4.99V: Bank 5 (Connectors/Prepositions)
- 5.0V - 5.99V: Bank 6 (Time/Place)
- 6.0V - 6.99V: Bank 7 (Emotions/States)
- 7.0V - 7.99V: Bank 8 (Numbers/Quantities)
- 8.0V - 8.99V: Bank 9 (Questions/Interjections)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Total words per bank:** Aim for ~20-25 words per bank for manageable voltage resolution
2. **Alphabetical within banks:** For predictability when sequencing
3. **Voltage spacing:** With 25 words per bank, each word occupies ~0.04V
4. **CV input precision:** Most sequencers provide enough resolution for word selection
5. **Morpheme flexibility:** Some words work in multiple contexts (e.g., "love" as verb or noun)

## Future Considerations

- **Alternate vocabulary packs:** Different themes (sci-fi, nature, abstract)
- **Language packs:** Spanish, French, German vocabularies
- **Voice variations:** Same vocabulary with different vocal styles
- **User-loadable banks:** Allow users to create custom vocabularies
