# Choosing Between PatchSeq and Groovebox Advanced

Hello! If you're reading this, you've probably discovered that Voxglitch has two modules that look similar and seem to do similar things. You might be wondering which one is right for you, or whether you need both. Let's walk through it together.

## First, What Do These Modules Actually Do?

Most sequencers in VCV Rack send out notes or control voltages. You patch them to an oscillator, and each step plays a different pitch. Simple enough.

PatchSeq and Groovebox Advanced do something different. Instead of sequencing notes, they sequence entire sounds. Each step isn't just a pitch—it's a complete little synthesizer that you've designed. When the sequencer reaches that step, it plays whatever sound engine you've built there.

Imagine having a bunch of tiny modular synths lined up in a row, and a spotlight that moves from one to the next with each beat. That's the basic idea both modules share.

So why are there two of them? Because there are two different ways to think about organizing those sounds.

## PatchSeq: One Step, One Sound

PatchSeq keeps things simple. You have 16 steps, and each step has exactly one sound. Step 1 plays Sound 1. Step 5 plays Sound 5. They're paired together permanently.

When you click on a step button, you see that step's patch on the canvas. You build your sound there. When you click on a different step, you see a completely different canvas with a completely different sound. Each one is its own little world.

This approach is wonderful for variety. You can make step 1 a booming kick drum, step 2 a delicate bell, step 3 a screaming noise burst, and step 4 a soft pad. The sequencer plays through them and you get this constantly shifting landscape of textures.

PatchSeq also has something special: a randomize button. Click it, and the module will generate a complete, playable patch for you. It's like having a sound design assistant who comes up with ideas you never would have thought of yourself. There are different randomization styles too—some lean toward classic FM sounds, others toward ambient textures, others toward experimental weirdness.

## Groovebox Advanced: A Library of Sounds

Groovebox Advanced thinks about things differently. Instead of locking each step to its own sound, you build a collection of sounds—a library—and then decide which sounds play on which steps.

Let's say you create a nice kick drum sound. In PatchSeq, that kick would live on one specific step. In Groovebox Advanced, that kick lives in your library, and you can assign it to as many steps as you want. Put it on steps 1, 5, 9, and 13, and now you have a four-on-the-floor pattern using just one sound that you designed once.

This gets even more interesting because Groovebox Advanced lets you layer sounds. You can put your kick drum and a bass sound on the same step, and they'll both play together when the sequencer gets there. Build up a snare, a hi-hat, a chord stab—assign them to steps in whatever combination you like, and you're arranging a groove.

Groovebox Advanced also gives you 32 steps instead of 16, so you have more room for longer phrases and patterns.

## So Which One Should You Choose?

It really depends on how you like to work.

If you enjoy exploration and surprise—if you want to click a button and discover sounds you never would have designed, if you want maximum variety where every single step is completely different—PatchSeq is probably your tool.

If you enjoy composing and arranging—if you want to build a kit of sounds and then arrange them into patterns, if you want sounds to recur and layer and build into something structured—Groovebox Advanced gives you the flexibility for that.

And honestly? Some people use both. They'll use PatchSeq to generate ideas and discover unexpected sounds, then recreate their favorites in Groovebox Advanced where they can arrange them into proper compositions.

There's no wrong answer here. They're both instruments for making music, just with different personalities. Try whichever one sounds more appealing to how you work, and see where it takes you.
