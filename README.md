## Themes

![Theme Screen Capture](docs/images/home/light-theme.jpg)

As of version 2.20.0, Voxglitch modules now support themes!  I've created two themes that cover the basics: The "default" theme and the "light" theme.

When you start using any Voxglitch modules that support themes, a new file called **"Voxglitch.json"** will be created in your Rack User folder.  The location of this file will change depending on your operating system. On windows, this is Documents/Rack2/ and looks like this:

 ![user-folder-windows](docs/images/home/rack-user-folder.jpg)

 You can edit this file with a text editor to switch between “default” and “light” theme:
````
{
  "theme":"light"
}
````
````
{
  "theme":"default"
}
````

Just remember that you must use the modules once _before_ the Voxglitch.json file is created.  Creating new themes is beyond the scope of this documentation.  Please ask me directly if this interests you!
